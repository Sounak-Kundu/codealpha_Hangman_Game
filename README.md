# codealpha_Hangman_Game
This Hangman Game is a graphical word-guessing game built with Pygame.

The computer randomly selects a word from a word list, and the player must guess it one letter at a time. Each wrong guess adds a new part to the hangman drawing. The player wins if they guess all the letters before the hangman is fully drawn, and loses otherwise.

The interface provides clickable alphabet buttons, shows the hidden word with underscores for unguessed letters, and visually updates the hangman image for incorrect guesses â€” making the game both fun and interactive.
